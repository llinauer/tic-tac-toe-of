# tic-tac-toe-of

After finishing my reinforcement learning based Tic Tac Toe agent (https://github.com/llinauer/tic-tac-toe-rl), I was 
really proud. I thought, how cool that you can train an AI to play the game perfectly
with a mere 200 thousand rounds of training!

Some time later I read the book One Jump Ahead by Jonathan Schaeffer. In this book, Dr. Schaeffer
describes in great detail the development of his checkers playing program CHINOOK, but it also touches
some more general topics about game playing AI. The book is awesome by the way, and I would greatly recommend
anybody interested in such tings to read it.
Anyway, in one chapter, he does a comparison between machine learning and knowledge-based 
approaches and mentions there that learning everything from scratch, even if the knowledge is 
readily available, is at best, cumbersome.

Tic Tac Toe for example, is widely (universally?) known and everybody knows how to play.
Even after only some games, people know how to react in certain situations and probably many of them
develop a strategy to play perfectly.
A quick look on wikipedia confirms: 8 rules is all you need to be unbeatable.
8 rules vs. 200 thousand games! 

That really showed me how a little knowledge can go a long way in AI systems and that's also
why I wanted to create a good old-fashioned Tic Tac Toe program.
This is what this repository is about.


# Pre-requisites

This project is derived from https://github.com/llinauer/tic-tac-toe-rl and uses python3 with numpy.


# The rules

Let me state the rules for perfect play in Tic Tac Toe explicitly here:

The first rule of Tic Tac Toe is: you do not ... (jk)
